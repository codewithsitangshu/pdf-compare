# PDF Compare

![Alt Text](compare.gif)


Are you tired of manually comparing PDF files in your daily automation tasks? If so, you're not alone. I am also encounter the same challenge of needing to compare PDFs not just by text, but also by their visual appearance, pixel by pixel, to ensure no detail is missed. I could not find any good FREE library which is working out of the box to compare the PDF files.

I've developed a Java library utilizing Apache PDFBox, licensed under Apache License, Version 3. This library allows users to compare PDF documents in Text/Image mode, highlighting differences. Additionally, it can extract images from PDFs and save PDF pages as images, offering versatile functionality for various tasks. With this tool, users can streamline PDF-related workflows, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it a valuable asset for developers and professionals alike.
